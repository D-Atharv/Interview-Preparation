### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a SQL problem. You have a `Customer` table with columns `id`, `name`, and `referee_id`. The `id` is the primary key. Each row in this table represents a customer's id, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them. You need to find the names of customers who are not referred by the customer with `id = 2`. How would you approach this?

**Interviewee:** First, I would need to get a clear understanding of the table structure and the relationships here. From the example, it looks like some customers, such as Alex and Mark, have their `referee_id` as 2, meaning they were referred by the customer with `id = 2`.

**Interviewer:** Correct. What initial thoughts do you have about solving this problem?

**Interviewee:** One brute force way to approach this would be to iterate through each customer in the table, check if their `referee_id` is 2, and then exclude those customers from the result. In SQL terms, it would translate into selecting customers whose `referee_id` is not equal to 2 or is null.

**Interviewer:** Sounds reasonable. Can you state the query for this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:**
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

**Interviewer:** That works. Let's go over the complexity of this approach. What can you say about its time and space complexity?

**Interviewee:** The time complexity of this query is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Customer` table. This is because the query has to inspect each row once to check the `referee_id` condition. The space complexity is O(1) in terms of additional space required for the query execution itself, but the final result could have up to n rows.

### Optimizing the Approach

**Interviewer:** Your brute force solution is efficient for this problem. However, if we were to consider optimization, what could be done?

**Interviewee:** An index on the `referee_id` column could help to speed up the query performance, especially if the table is significantly large. The database management system can quickly locate rows where `referee_id` is not 2, instead of performing a full table scan.

**Interviewer:** Excellent point. Adding indices can certainly improve performance. Let's also focus on edge cases and ensures our query handles them appropriately. What if the `referee_id` has other non-null values?

**Interviewee:** The query should still hold under these conditions, as the `WHERE` clause explicitly checks for `referee_id` not equal to 2, accommodating other values or NULLs.

**Interviewer:** Very well. Let’s use a visual diagram to clarify the final result of your query. Assume you have the following Customer table:

```
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
``` 

**Interviewee:** Here is how the query processes each row:

- For ID 1 (Will): `referee_id` is `null`. (Included)
- For ID 2 (Jane): `referee_id` is `null`. (Included)
- For ID 3 (Alex): `referee_id` is 2. (Excluded)
- For ID 4 (Bill): `referee_id` is `null`. (Included)
- For ID 5 (Zack): `referee_id` is 1. (Included)
- For ID 6 (Mark): `referee_id` is 2. (Excluded)

So, the final result:
```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

Here's a simple depiction:

```
             ,----+------+------------,
             | id | name | referee_id  |
             |====|======|=============|
             |  1 | Will | NULL        |  <-- [Included: ref_id is NULL]
             |  2 | Jane | NULL        |  <-- [Included: ref_id is NULL]
             |  3 | Alex | 2           |  <-- [Excluded: ref_id is 2]
             |  4 | Bill | NULL        |  <-- [Included: ref_id is NULL]
             |  5 | Zack | 1           |  <-- [Included: ref_id is 1]
             |  6 | Mark | 2           |  <-- [Excluded: ref_id is 2]
             '----+------+------------'
```

**Interviewer:** That’s a clear and accurate interpretation. Good job!

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for the query execution, O(n) for the result set

### Summary
For each SQL variant and Pandas, the brute force solution involves querying and filtering based on the `referee_id` column. The time complexity for each solution is O(n) due to the need to inspect each row in the table once. The space complexity is O(1) for the query execution itself, but it can be O(n) if we consider the size of the result set. In Pandas, both time and space complexity are O(n) because it processes and stores the resulting DataFrame in memory.

Note that SQL-based solutions can benefit from indexing on `referee_id` to improve performance in practical scenarios.


### Closing Statement

During this interview discussion, we explored how to retrieve the names of customers who were not referred by the customer with `id = 2` from a `Customer` table. 

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - We began with a straightforward approach involving a simple SQL query that selects customers whose `referee_id` is not 2 or is `NULL`.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) for the query execution, with potential O(n) space for the result set.

2. **Performance Improvements:**
   - Indexing on the `referee_id` column was discussed as a means to potentially improve query performance.
   
3. **Implementation:**
   - We provided example implementations in various SQL languages (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL) and a Python Pandas implementation for diverse usage scenarios.

This problem illustrates fundamental SQL filtering operations and basic optimization techniques, which are essential skills for working with relational databases and data analysis frameworks.

   ```sql
   SELECT name
   FROM (
       SELECT name, COUNT(referee_id) AS ref_count
       FROM Customer
       GROUP BY name
   ) AS Subquery
   WHERE ref_count > 1;
   ```

5. **Find Top Referrers:**
   - Determine which customers have referred the most other customers.
   ```sql
   SELECT referee_id, COUNT(*) AS num_referrals
   FROM Customer
   WHERE referee_id IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY referee_id
   ORDER BY num_referrals DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
