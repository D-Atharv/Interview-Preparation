### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Today we'll be solving a problem that requires you to add two integers, `a` and `b`, without using the `+` or `-` operators. Here is the problem statement:

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators `+` and `-`.

**Interviewee:** Okay, that's interesting! First, let me clarify the problem with some examples:

For instance, if `a = 1` and `b = 2`, the output should be `3`; and if `a = 2` and `b = 3`, the output should be `5`. All right, the constraints are that `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`.

**Interviewer:** Correct. Do you have any initial thoughts on how to approach this?

**Interviewee:** My first thought is to consider how addition works at the bit level. Since I can't use `+` or `-`, I'll need to explore bitwise operations like AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`). Using these operators might help us mimic the addition process.

### Initial Thoughts on Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** For a brute force solution, I could manually add values, but that wouldn't be efficient or pretty since it likely still relies on `+` internally. Instead, I think I'll start by breaking down how addition works using bit manipulation:

1. **XOR (`^`)** can be used to add bits without considering the carry.
2. **AND (`&`)** followed by left shift (`<<`) can compute the carry.

For example, for `a = 2` (binary: `10`) and `b = 3` (binary: `11`):
- `a ^ b` will give `01` (binary for `1 + 1` without carry).
- `(a & b) << 1` will give `10` (binary for carry `1`).

Now, you continue this process iteratively until there is no carry left.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Interviewer:** That sounds correct. Can you discuss the time and space complexity of this initial approach?

**Interviewee:** Sure. Let's assume `n` is the number of bits in the integers:

- **Time Complexity:** The iterative process relies on the number of bits, and each iteration reduces the number of bits where there is a carry. In the worst case, this takes `O(n)` iterations, where `n` is proportional to the number of bits (32 for standard integers).
- **Space Complexity:** We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables; therefore, the space complexity is `O(1)`.

**Interviewer:** Good analysis. Now, could you go ahead and write the code to implement this?

**Interviewee:** Sure, using bitwise operators:

```python
def getSum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b != 0:
        carry = (a & b) << 1   # Calculate carry
        a = a ^ b              # Sum without carry
        b = carry              # Assign carry to b
    return a
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

**Interviewee:** Here's a visual step-by-step explanation for understanding:

1. Take two numbers, `a` and `b`.

2. Perform the XOR operation on `a` and `b`, which gives the sum without carry.

3. Perform the AND operation on `a` and `b`, then left shift the result to get the carry bit.

4. Repeat the process until no carry is left.

- Suppose `a = 2` (binary `10`) and `b = 3` (binary `11`):
    - `a ^ b = 01` (this is `1` in decimal, as it ignores carry).
    - `(a & b) << 1 = 10` (this is `2` in decimal, as it is the carry).
    - Now, `a` becomes `1` (result from XOR) and `b` becomes `2` (result from carry).

Continue to sum `a` and `b` until `b` becomes `0`.

### Diagram Illustration
Hereâ€™s a diagram to illustrate the process:

```plaintext
Step 1:
a = 10 (binary for 2)
b = 11 (binary for 3)

a ^ b = 01 (binary for 1, sum without carry)
(a & b) << 1 = 10 (binary for 2, the carry shifted left)

Step 2:
a = 01 (binary for 1)
b = 10 (binary for 2)

a ^ b = 11 (binary for 3, sum without carry)
(a & b) << 1 = 00 (binary for 0, no carry)

Final Result:
a = 11 (binary for 3)
b = 00 (binary for 0)
```

Hence the result is `3`.

Each implementation leverages bitwise operations to achieve the addition, making them efficient in both time and space. For all the implementations, the time complexity is `O(1)` because we are limited by the fixed number of bits in integer representation (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit). The space complexity is also `O(1)` because only a constant amount of space is used regardless of the input sizes.
