### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

#### Interviewer:
Let's discuss the problem. Given `n` coins, you need to build a staircase where the `i-th` row requires `i` coins. The staircase may have an incomplete last row. Your task is to return the number of complete rows of the staircase. Is the problem statement clear?

#### Interviewee:
Yes, I understand the problem. We're supposed to arrange the coins in a staircase pattern such that the first row has 1 coin, the second row has 2 coins, and so on. We need to find out how many of these rows can be fully completed with the given `n` coins.

#### Interviewer:
Exactly. How would you approach this problem initially?

#### Interviewee:
I can think of a brute force approach initially. We can start with the first row and keep adding rows until the number of coins in the current row exceeds the remaining coins. For each row, we'll decrement the total coins by the number of coins required for that row.

### Brute Force Approach

The pseudocode for the brute force approach could be:

1. Initialize `current_row` to 1 and a variable `complete_rows` to 0.
2. While `n` is greater than or equal to `current_row`:
    - Subtract `current_row` from `n`.
    - Increment `complete_rows`.
    - Increment `current_row`.
3. Return `complete_rows`.

#### Interviewer:
That sounds like a good start. Could you describe the time and space complexity of this brute force approach?

#### Interviewee:
Sure. Let's analyze the complexities:

- **Time Complexity**: In the worst case, we'll have to iterate through each row until the total number of coins is less than the next row's coin requirement. This results in a time complexity of \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of complete rows. Since the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is approximately \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), solving for `k` gives us \(k = O(\sqrt{n})\). Thus, the time complexity is \(O(\sqrt{n})\).

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Optimizing the Approach

#### Interviewer:
Good analysis. Can we optimize this further?

#### Interviewee:
Yes, we can optimize the solution using a mathematical approach. The problem of finding the number of complete rows can be translated into finding the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` integers is less than or equal to `n`.

The formula for the sum of the first `k` rows is:
\[ S = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \]

We need to find the largest `k` such that:
\[ \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \leq n \]
\[ k^2 + k \leq 2n \]

This can be solved using the quadratic formula \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\):
\[ k = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
For our equation \(k^2 + k - 2n = 0\), we get:
\[ k = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2} \]

We take the floor of this value to get the maximum number of complete rows.

#### Interviewer:
Good insight! That optimizes the process significantly. Could you draw a visual representation to help explain this?

#### Interviewee:
Certainly! Let's draw the staircase for `n = 8` for better clarity.

```
n = 8
Staircase:
1st row: 1 coin
2nd row: 2 coins
3rd row: 3 coins
4th row: 2 coins (incomplete)

Visual Representation:

     *
   * *
 * * *
* *    (4th row is incomplete)

Number of complete rows = 3
```

By using the formula:
\[ k = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 8 \cdot 8}}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{65}}{2} \approx \frac{7.06}{2} \approx 3.53 \]

Taking the floor value, we get `k = 3`.

### Final Optimized Code

Here's the Python code based on the optimized approach:

```python
import math

def arrangeCoins(n: int) -> int:
    return int((-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * n)) // 2)

# Testing the function
print(arrangeCoins(5))  # Output: 2
print(arrangeCoins(8))  # Output: 3
```

### Time and Space Complexity of Optimized Solution

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the mathematical approach is \(O(1)\) because we are performing a constant number of operations irrespective of the input size.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(1)\) since we do not use any additional space that grows with the input size.
